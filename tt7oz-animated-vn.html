With the Japanese release of Steins;Gate Elite (a fully animated version of the original novel), how do you think this will impact the industry? If it does well, would there be a chance of more fully animated releases? What are yall's thoughts. Anime pictures and wallpapers for everyone! (ex mjv-art.org) You can see a lot of pictures, upload yours, track trends, and communicate! We want to make the best collection of Modern Asian. 
With the release of Nekopara coming up (which uses E-Mote or 'EmoFuri') I think it'd be an interesting question to ask, what do you think of those VNs where mouths move and people blink? Do you find it adds to the VN or is too disconcerting? Personally, I've found that the engine matters a lot. I think EmoFuri is the closest you can get to an anime in VN form, and it's genuinely possible to feel immersed. Live2D is too deep in uncanny valley to be useful for anything but smartphone clock Long post incoming haha (spoiler for C's identity) I just finished my first Trails game, and boy was this a ride. I have absolutely no idea how I managed to ignore the Trails series until this day; I've been a huge JRPG fan for years and never even read the name anywhere. Whatever, what counts is that I played it now and damn, I have a lot to say. I'd like to give my thoughts some order by writing a kinda-review. Let's start with. the Story: To be fair, going into a game knowing. I'm actually excited for this one. I love the idea of this game so far because I can't get enough of games with stealth, or being a ghost ! It's also another one of those FULLY ANIMATED VNs ! More games are doing this lately! This is the future of visual novels. This game will make a fine addition to my collection. I can't wait! https://www.play-asia.com/punch-line/13/70c0br. 
Just finished the VN of the first and now I'm playing through 0. But is the anime worth watching if I already know the story? Is there anything original in the anime. (/butt)Hello again! Today's the 9th round of deals. How much have you spent already? We've only a few days left! Here's some general advice: wait for daily deals and flash sales, as those are the deepest discounts that particular game will get for the sale. If a game you want doesn't go on sale, wait until the last day to buy it! Use this thread to discuss happenings and recommend games to other people! Number One Deal for Today If I had to buy only one game today, it'd be Age of Empir. As someone who only watched the anime (all of it this past week) I learned that this is all actually based of a game and not a manga. From what I can tell Elite is a remake of the first SG VN, but with new animations. Do we know if these animations are simply from the anime? Is there more content or improvements? Im absolutely hooked on SG but if Elite is simply a better version of the current VN I can wait. Also do we have a timeframe on release. Just curious and not caught up on the magical world ov VN's. Is there even more content and games so they COULD do another show or is Steins;Gate and 0 the only "real" story to it? Thanks. I wanted to ask you all a question. If your favorite visual novels were able to be redone but in actual 3d would you like it? What I mean is that it would play like a game cutscene function but still have it's texts like normal visual novels do to portray certain events in the story. It will still have it's decision system for making good or bad choices. Same new route paths that unlock with choices. Think of it like (Telltale games) in a sense but without the timer. Wouldn't Like with School Days HQ, the game is basically an anime where the player decides what happens, and watches a fully animated result. It's more immersive. (Although, it's interesting that the actual anime is just a censored retelling for one of the endings, or paths.). I've started reading VNs with Nekopara. Not the most engaging read but it's simplicity, light-hearted nature, recent artstyle that's easy on the eyes and the important part, pretty nice animation in the adult scenes and non adult scenes, make it an easy read and pretty relaxing. So in that vein, I'm looking for other VNs with a current artstyle that are light and vanilla, preferably with a more comedic slant, though that's not absolutely necessary, with animation throughout. More loosely. 
Across all the fate related animes there have been varying differences on how the GoB is supposed to be displayed/seen by the characters. In DEEN stay night (when he kills Caster), parts of the VN (when he fights Saber and Shirou near the bridge), and parts of 3rei (when Gil recovers his swords) it's supposed to be an invisible door, and characters comment that they only see swords floating in mid air. However in Zero and UBW, and in 3rei as well we see golden portals. Is this merely suppose. I'm mostly just putting this down because of nervousness, and I figured this was a better place than anywhere else. While I could go on for hours about all the visual novels I have and haven't played, I don't have probably more than 20 minutes at the helm. Some of that time is going to be playing an actual visual novel on the screen, jumping between saves to get a feel for the game. I'm gonna use Never7, the prequel to Ever17, because I feel the story is less insanely interwoven than other. Post the genre that you think works the best or that you favor above all. If you don't have a favorite genre, you can post your favorite VN and its genre as well. If the genre that you think is the best and/or like the best has already been mentioned, upvote that post to show that you agree. I've been playing a lot of Telltale lately and I got to thinking how awesome a Trigun or Bebop game might turn out, or even Black Lagoon. So I have to wonder, what other games would translate well to a story/character driven game style? It doesn't have to be Telltale specifically, it can be DontNod, Quantic, whichever you think you would </p>
