So I was rewatching the end of DS9 and a few points stand out to me: Sisko says to Kasidy that: a) That he had to stay in the Temple to learn new things (control of time?) b) That his life is non-linear and he could return in a year or yesterday. Leaving aside the real world intent - isn't it possible that Sisko spend hundreds of years in the temple learning new things and then just walks up to Jack and Kira as soon as the show finishes because he can enter linear time at whatever point.

Feb 09, 2012 · Alexis Petridis: Simon Cowell loves her - but don't let that put you off. Emeli's Sande's debut is a good, if incomplete, display of her talents. Hi there, so like the title says I'm separating from my husband, and soon after I moved out realized that he was abusive to me for our entire relationship.

During rose's explanation of events it seemed as if she was not giving the correct information bout these events to come and have come to pass. She is wrong about the juju resembling a hole when empty. It becomes intangible when full. And then her explanation of 'sustaining our version of events' does not seem to fly with paradox space's mechanics.along with her assurance that john will do great and that hug. As if saying goodbye. It is not the only bits that she seemed wrong about either. View credits, reviews, tracks and shop for the 2012 CD release of Our Version Of Events on Discogs. Chapter One. I've always thought our version of events would be different. I'm trying to understand. I am. I don't want you to go. Don't. Please. I crashed my car today. I signaled for a left hand turn across a clear oncoming lane to a parking lot and shortly began my turn. Heard a honk and less than a second later the front left of my bumper crashed into an SUV that had apparently crossed a solid double yellow line and had been attempting to overtake me on the left in the oncoming traffic lane. As we pulled over I got out and was asking if they were okay, but was cut off by two women who exited the vehicle yelling all sorts of nonsense.
